# OxideTerm Native Beta

This is a beta OxideTerm native desktop release.

Use this channel when you want to test changes before they reach the stable channel. Beta builds may include packaging, updater, compatibility, and workflow changes that still need wider validation.

## What This Beta Is

- A pre-stable OxideTerm desktop build.
- Intended for users who can tolerate small regressions and report issues with enough detail to reproduce them.
- Published with updater metadata for the beta channel.
- Less stable than the stable channel and intended for pre-release validation.

<!-- RELEASE_CHANGELOG -->

## Beta Notes

- Keep a stable build installed if OxideTerm is business-critical for your daily work.
- Report regressions with OS, CPU architecture, installed asset name, and steps to reproduce.
- If a beta workflow behaves differently from the stable release, include both results in the issue.
